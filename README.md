👋 Hi, I’m @sandra281298
👀 I’m interested in Supply Chain and Data 
🌱 I have developed advanced skills in Excel and Data Analytics working hard to upskill my data analytics toolkit. These skills have enabled me to effectively analyze sales, finance, business and optimize supply chain processes.
🌱 Currently broadening my focus to Project Management, which will help me to efficiently lead and execute projects in the Industry.
🙏🏾 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will contribute to my portfolio.
💞️ Humanistic data (data derived from human activity) is my favorite data to work with, as well as supply chain development.
